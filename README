The Automated Tilt and Compliance Removal (ATaCR, pronounced attacker ) package is developed for characterizing and removing tilt and compliance noise from ocean bottom seismometer (OBS) instruments. Details related to the quality control procedures used to obtain stationsâ€™ noise characteristics can be found in Janiszewski et al. (2019). We employ tilt and compliance corrections based on the methods of Crawford and Webb (2000) and Bell et al. (2014). Please see the ATaCR Manual for more details.
